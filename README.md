## Continued Development

During this project, I faced some challenges and identified areas for improvement:

- Background Design: Adjusting the background design to match the provided specifications was challenging. I aim to improve my skills in positioning and aligning background elements accurately.

- Animating Chat Elements: I need to implement animations for the chat elements on loading. Learning more about CSS animations and JavaScript libraries for animations will be my focus.
